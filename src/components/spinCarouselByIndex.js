Under the support and guidance of the Ennovate team, students participating in the Ennovate program will create a mini social-enterprise that addresses a pressing social or environmental concern, replicating that of a business that would thrive in the real world. At the very end of the program, students will pitch their developed businesses to a panel of industry professionals, showcasing all of their hard work.</h3>

By the end of the program, all students showcase and celebrate their work at Enspire Day, our annual flagship event. </h3>

We facilitate the donation of excess food from organizations and food retailers to UBC distribution sites, where the food is given to students facing food insecurity. This year, we plan on further tackling the issue of food waste by expanding outside of UBC and helping food-insecure residents in the Lower Mainland. We are also planning innovative ways to use upcycled organics to empower organizations in the environmental sector and inspire students to create change in their communities.</h3>

Through interactive workshops, modules and a final conference, we educate on topics such as the history of settler colonialism, Indigenous history, and Indigenous rights. Currently, we are preparing to formally launch our program in high schools this upcoming September.</h3>
